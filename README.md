# Get Involved

In order to participate in a Guidehouse Responded code challenge, all Guidehouse teaming partners (and external participants) must agree to an appropriate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).  These CLA's must be passed to the Hackathon owner, and submitted as a bundle to [Dawn Cassie](mailto: dcassie@guidehouse.com) for registration and so that Guidehouse can negotiate appropriate terms with the Hackathon Sponsoring organization.  

Further, each Hackathon should have a 'project'-hackathon-details repository that includes notes, agreements, and any additional provided materials so that the complete set of governing documents are made available.

## Enclosed in this repository are two CLA's:

- [Guidehouse CLA designed for organizations who team and participate](corporate-cla.pdf)
- [Guidehouse CLA designed for individuals (non affiliated) who participate](individual-cla.pdf)
